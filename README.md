# 📊 Business Intelligence Decision Analytics Projects

Welcome to my **Business Intelligence & Decision Analytics academic project repository**! Here, I document the journey of collaboratively building, training, and evaluating **machine learning models** for business intelligence solutions with a friend, focusing on practical data-driven decision-making.

In our academic projects, we followed **three clear phases**:

1️⃣ **Phase 1: Data Split** – dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure accurate model evaluation.  
2️⃣ **Phase 2: Data Cleaning** – handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and normalizing features to prepare the data for modeling.  
3️⃣ **Phase 3: Model Implementation and Analysis** – applying and tuning machine learning models while tracking error rates and insights for business intelligence decision-making.

These phases structured our workflow for consistent, professional academic projects and results.

## 🚀 Project Overview

### 🎯 Project Goal:
To predict the income of **10,000 people** using **five different machine learning models** and analyze their strengths and weaknesses for business intelligence applications.

### ⚡ What We Did:
- Trained and tested models including **KNN, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayesian classifiers**.
- Compared and analyzed error rates between **10.81% and 18.55%**.
- Identified the best-performing model (KNN with k=3) achieving **89.19% accuracy**.
- Prepared recommendations for further improvement.

## 📈 Results Table

| Rank | Model | Algorithm | Error % | Notes |
|------|-------|-----------|---------|-------|
| 🥇 1 | Model 3 | KNN (k=3) | 10.81% | Best accuracy |
| 🥈 2 | Model 4 | KNN (k=5) | 13.3% | Better than k=10 |
| 🥉 3 | Model 2 | Naive Bayesian | 14.54% | Reasonable accuracy |
| 4 | Model 5 | KNN (k=10) | 15.32% | Acceptable |
| 5 | Model 1 | Decision Tree | 18.55% | Least accurate |

We discovered that **Model 3 (KNN with k=3) outperformed all other models**, making it the preferred choice for this dataset. However, Naive Bayesian and KNN (k=5) also provided reasonably accurate predictions.

## 🛠️ Further Improvement Plan

✅ Execute "Phase 4: Model Improvement.", that is to improve all five models using **Python (scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib)** for deeper parameter tuning and visual analysis.

✅ Execute "Phase 5: **Implement advanced models**":
- **Model 6:** Random Forest Classifier to test its ensemble power vs. individual models.
- **Model 7:** Neural Network for potential non-linear improvements and comparison.

✅ Analyze improvements by comparing updated error rates, ROC curves, and execution speed.

✅ Document insights for each model to evaluate their suitability for business intelligence tasks.

## 🤝 Collaboration
This project was **collaboratively completed with a friend**, improving our team problem-solving skills while applying analytics to real-world business datasets.

We split responsibilities:
- **I handled** data cleaning, KNN/Decision Tree experiments, Naive Bayesian testing and error analysis.
- **My collaborator** worked on documentation drafts, and presentation preparations.

We regularly discussed improvements and next steps, fostering clear and effective teamwork.

## 📚 Next Steps
- Transition to Python for deeper analysis.
- Expand into unsupervised models for segmentation.
- Test the scalability of our models with larger datasets.
- Apply these models to practical business cases like churn prediction or customer segmentation.
